# Introduction to Creative Commons Library Certificate

The Creative Commons Librarian Certificate is designed to help educate librarians on the use, and implementation of [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) (CC) within their institutions. 

Librarians face a number of Intellectual Property, Open Movement and Creative Commons related issues across all types of library institutions (public, university, school).  The CC Librarian Certificate  aim is to ensure all participants have the knowledge and skills they need to successfully perform Creative Commons related responsibilities and to educate others about the licenses. Librarians are front line officers and major advocates in the open movement.  

On completion of the certificate librarian will be able to explain the benefits of Creative Commons licenses to all members of their institutions to support the curation and creation of  open educational resources for the needs of the staff to  provide training about Creative Commons to raise awareness and plan systematic changes towards openness in within their institutions.
