# Creative Commons Core Certification

*CC-CERT-CORE v0.3 Feb 9 2017*

This GitHub repository will be the canonical content for structure of the core units of Creative Commons certifications that will be incorporated into the three specialty offerings

* [Library](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-cert-lib/blob/master/index.md)
* [Government](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-cert-gov/blob/master/index.md)
* [Education](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-cert-edu/blob/master/index.md)


This repository is primarily for the design team to use as the master content. We are developing it Markdown format so it can be easily be deployed to our demonstration public Wordpress site http://certificates.creativecommons.org/certs but potentially other platforms that publish web content form Markdown (see more about [our technical approach](https://certificates.creativecommons.org/category/tech/).
