# Creative Commons Certifications: This is The Source


[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/creativecommons/cc-cert-map.svg?label=ready&title=Waffle)](http://waffle.io/creativecommons/cc-cert-map)

This GitHub repository will be the canonical content for structure of the Creative Commons Certifications. As this time, this is primarily for the design team to use as the master content. We are developing it Markdown format so it can be easily be deployed to our demonstration public Wordpress site http://certificates.creativecommons.org/certs but potential other platforms that publish web content form Markdown (see more about [our technical approach](https://certificates.creativecommons.org/category/tech/).
