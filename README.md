# Creative Commons Certification - Core

This GitHub repo will be the canonical content for Core Certification, from which the first three Specialized Certifications will be forked from. As of this time, this is for the design team to use as the master content, and used e.g. as content for the public web site http://certificates.creativecommons.org/core 

All content will be produced with standard GitHub Markdown. Some more specific instructions will  replace this dull sentence.

*One more note- these pages are not a layout design per se but a framing of the types of information to be included.*
