## Learning Experience

To help you learn Legal Implementation each unit of learning has:

1. A set of learning objectives

2. Open Educational Resources for you to use in fulfilling those objectives

3. Learning activities / assessments that ask you to apply the learning to your own context and generate evidence demonstrating you've accomplished the learning. 

Learning units have been sequenced to have a logical flow but you can take them in any order. Start with the one that interests you the most.
