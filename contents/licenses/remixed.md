# Remixing Differently Licensed Works

Understanding the differences between Creative Commons licenses is important, but how do you deal with situations where you create content from materials that have different licenses?

## The Big Question

Open content and open educational resources do not have one, universal copyright conditions. If you saw or used any Creative Commons content (or under other free licenses) you probably noticed that many of their conditions rule out the others. So how do mix them to create something that will be open and wonâ€™t break the internet (and someone's copyright)?

Exclusive conditions allow people to choose perfect licenses, adjusted to their needs but it also influence a lot, how this work will be used.

Creative Commons licenses are designed for ease of use. Users can see in a transparent manner how your work is available for reuse. Things can become complicated however if you want to combine two Creative Commons licensed works, for example when making a collage or remixes of music. *Not all licenses are in fact to compatible.* 

Knowing how to mix different licenses is crucial for making new content safe, useful and successful. 

## Learning Outcomes

* Compare compatibility between licenses
* Determine license compatibility/interoperability
* Avoid license incompatibility
* Understand Creative Commons remix chart
* Understand license stacking
* Understand Non-Creative Commons license compatibility


## Personal Reflection / Why It Matters to You  
  
How do you search for Creative Commons licensed content? Do you start with selecting the license or you look for the content first and then narrow it down according to license? How often do you see materials you would like to combine that are under different licenses? Do you even bother to check the license during your research?

Try to remember your strategies, questions or problems you have encountered when using different content under Creative Commons licenses.

Choose two works you wish to combine or remix. Find the license of the first work on the first row and the license on the first column. You can combine the works if there is a check mark in the cell where the row and column intersect. Use at least the most restrictive licensing of the two (use the license most to right or down state) for the new work. 

If there a cross at the intersection of the row and column then you can not just these works. This probably indicates that one of the two licenses may not used for commercial purposes, or one of the licenses does not allow for derivative works to be created

### Remix works with a Non-Commercial building block

It is not possible to mix works where the first work is placed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license and the second work is licensed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. The ShareAlike building block in first license requires that the newly created work is released under that license and can therefore be used commercially, the second license wants you to release the new work under a license that does not permit commercial use.

### Remix work with a No-Derivative building block
It is not possible to use in a remix where No-Derivative is a building block in processing a work. All works have been released under this License may only be distributed. Into their original form There may of these works so no cropping or lower resolution works be made available. May also (parts of) these works are not used for other works.

You can see from the graph below how specific conditions affect not only one resource potential but at scale how they can grow the free culture. 

If you want to learn more about license compatibility in educational context see the WikiEducator OER handbook For Educators chapter on [License Compatibility](http://wikieducator.org/OER_Handbook/educator_version_one/License/License_compatibility).

If you are interested in how Creative Commons license compatibility works with Wikipedia and open source licenses check out the [Wikipedia article on all Free and Open Source licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses). 
   
Also, try the [OER Remix Game](http://indstudy1.org/univ/355460515034/Flash/Lesson2/PracticeVersion.html) where you have to remix four differently licensed  text, images, music, and video to create a new copyright compliant resource (requires Flash).

## Application of Learning

### Learner Toolkit
Select two or three resources directly relevant to your personal or work-related CC needs from the Acquiring Essential Knowledge content and add them to your personal Creative Commons toolkit. Adding them to your toolkit makes them easy to find and use when the need arises, and makes it easy for you to pass on resources you consider important to others. Annotate the resources with notes explaining why they are relevant and important for you and your work.

### Community - Collaboration, Appreciation, Recognition, Gratitude
Post a story about how you benefited from someone who chose to share their creative works under a Creative Commons license in the CC Certificate social forum. Alternatively, share a description of (and link to, if applicable) a community that engages in commons-based peer production that others might not be aware of.
