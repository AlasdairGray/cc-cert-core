# Introduction to the Creative Commons Core Certification

Creative Commons CORE is meant to capture the full breadth and depth of learning associated with having comprehensive expertise in everything related to Creative Commons. CORE certification is seen as something Creative Commons and it's global community will take to ensure staff and public representatives have essential Creative Commons knowledge and skills. CORE acts as foundational curricula from which specialized Creative Commons certificates can be built. CORE has required and optional modules.

* **Required Modules**
  * [Copyright Basics](core/copyright.md)
  * [The Commons](core/commons.md)
  * [CC License Suite](core/licenses.md)
  * [Social/Cultural Implementation](core/social-cultural.md)
  
* Plus one or more **Optional Modules**
  * [Legal Implementation](core/legal.md)
  * [Technical Implementation](core/technical.md)
  * [International Implementation](core/international.md)

Optional modules provide participants with the opportunity to gain deeper knowledge directly related to their interests or requirements. CORE in it's entirety (all of required and all of optional) is the means by which someone becomes certified as a Creative Commons train-the-trainer.
