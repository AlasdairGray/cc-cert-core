Creative Commons licenses are standardized to work the same way everywhere in the world. Differences in copyright law and regional practices need to be taken into account for international implementation of Creative Commons. 

The International Implementation module has five units of learning:

1. Country Specific Copyright Regulations
2. Copyright vs. Other Intellectual Property (IP)
3. Public Domain 
4. Limitation of Copyright
5. Communicating with Creative Commons

## Learning Experience

To help you learn International Implementation each unit of learning has:

1. A set of learning objectives

2. Open Educational Resources for you to use in fulfilling those objectives

3. Learning activities / assessments that ask you to apply the learning to your own context and generate evidence demonstrating you've accomplished the learning. 

Learning units have been sequenced to have a logical flow but you can take them in any order. Start with the one that interests you the most.
