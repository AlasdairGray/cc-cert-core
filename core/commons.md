# The Commons

![The Commons](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-cert-map/blob/master/img/TheCommons.jpg "The Commons")

The Commons has long played a historical role in making cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society. Creative Commons is part of that long tradition and understanding the Commons and how it works is essential to successfully using Creative Commons.

The Commons module has four units of learning:

1. Significance of the Commons
2. Compare / Contrast Physical vs Digital Commons
3. Understand Commons Opportunity 
4. Creative Commons

## Learning Experience

To help you learn The Commons each unit of learning has:

1. A set of learning objectives

2. Open Educational Resources for you to use in fulfilling those objectives

3. Learning activities / assessments that ask you to apply the learning to your own context and generate evidence demonstrating you've accomplished the learning. 

Learning units have been sequenced to have a logical flow but you can take them in any order. Start with the one that interests you the most.
