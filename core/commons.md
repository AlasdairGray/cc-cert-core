# The Commons

The Commons has long played a historical role in making cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society. 

Creative Commons is part of that long tradition and understanding the Commons and how it works is essential to successfully using Creative Commons.

  * http://bollier.org/commons-short-and-sweet
  * I am always trying to figure out how to explain the idea of the commons to newcomers who find it hard to grasp.  In  preparation for a talk that I gave at the Caux Forum for Human Security, near Montreux, Switzerland, I came up with a fairly short overview, which I have copied below.  I think it gets to the nub of things. 
The commons is….
  ·       A social system for the long-term stewardship of resources that preserves shared values and community identity. 
  ·       A self-organized system by which communities manage resources (both depletable and and replenishable) with minimal or no reliance on the Market or State.
  ·       The wealth that we inherit or create together and must pass on, undiminished or enhanced, to our children.  Our collective wealth includes the gifts of nature, civic infrastructure, cultural works and traditions, and knowledge.
  ·       A sector of the economy (and life!) that generates value in ways that are often taken for granted – and often jeopardized by the Market-State.
  * There is no master inventory of commons because a commons arises whenever a given community decides it wishes to manage a resource in a collective manner, with special regard for equitable access, use and sustainability. 
  * The commons is not a resource.  It is a resource plus a defined community and the protocols, values and norms devised by the community to manage its resources.  Many resources urgently need to be managed as commons, such as the atmosphere, oceans, genetic knowledge and biodiversity.
  * There is no commons without commoning – the social practices and norms for managing a resource for collective benefit.     * Forms of commoning naturally vary from one commons to another because humanity itself is so varied.  And so there is no “standard template” for commons; merely “fractal affinities” or shared patterns and principles among commons.  The commons must be understood, then, as a verb as much as a noun.  A commons must be animated by bottom-up participation, personal responsibility, transparency and self-policing accountability.
  * One of the great unacknowledged problems of our time is the enclosure of the commons, the expropriation and commercialization of shared resources, usually for private market gain.  Enclosure can be seen in the patenting of genes and lifeforms, the use of copyrights to lock up creativity and culture, the privatization of water and land, and attempts to transform the open Internet into a closed, proprietary marketplace, among many other enclosures.
  * Enclosure is about dispossession.  It privatizes and commodifies resources that belong to a community or to everyone, and dismantles a commons-based culture (egalitarian co-production and co-governance) with a market order (money-based producer/consumer relationships and hierarchies).  Markets tend to have thin commitments to localities, cultures and ways of life; for any commons, however, these are indispensable.
  * The classic commons are small-scale and focused on natural resources; an estimated two billion people depend upon commons of forests, fisheries, water, wildlife and other natural resources for their everyday subsistence.  But the contemporary struggle of commoners is to find new structures of law, institutional form and social practice that can enable diverse sorts of commons to work at larger scales and to protect their resources from market enclosure. 
  * Open networks are a natural hosting infrastructure for commons.  They provide accessible, low-cost spaces for people to devise their own forms of governance, rules, social practices and cultural expression. That’s why the Internet has spawned so many robust, productive commons: free and open source software, Wikipedia and countless wikis, more than 10,000 open access scholarly journals, the open educational resources (OER) movement, the open data movement, sites for collaborative art and culture, Fab Labs that blend global design with local production, and much else. In an age of capital-driven network platforms such as Facebook, Google and Uber, however, digital commons must take affirmative steps to protect the wealth they generate.
  * New commons forms and practices are needed at all levels – local, regional, national and global – and there is a need for new types of federation among commoners and linkages between different tiers of commons.  Trans-national commons are especially needed to help align governance with ecological realities and serve as a force for reconciliation across political boundaries.  Thus to actualize the commons and deter market enclosures, we need innovations in law, public policy, commons-based governance, social practice and culture.  All of these will manifest a very different worldview than now prevails in established governance systems, particularly those of the State and Market.
1.1.3 Now that we understand the commons, let’s talk a little bit about why the commons is important. https://web.archive.org/web/20130617041302/http://www.boell.org/downloads/Benkler_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Commons.pdf (CC BY)
  * Why Commons? Commons are institutional spaces, in which we can practice a particular type of freedom – freedom from the constraints we normally accept as necessary preconditions to functional markets. • Though we often think of ‘free markets’ as spaces that enable free choice, in fact these are structured relationships intended to elicit a particular datum – the comparative willingness and ability of agents to pay money for resource. • The most important constraints under-girding markets are those we usually call property. Property is a cluster of background rules that determine - what resources each of us has when we come into relations with others - what ‘having’ or ‘lacking’ a resource allows us to do or refuse to do in relations surrounding resources. These rules impose constraints on who can do what in the domain of actions that require access to resources that are the subjects of property law. • While a necessary precondition for markets, property law means that choice in markets is itself not free of constraints, but is instead constrained in a particular pattern. • Commons are institutional spaces where human agents can act free of the particular constraints required for markets. • This does not mean that commons are anarchic spaces. Purely free action is illusory. • It means that individuals and groups can use resources governed under different types of constraints than those imposed by property law. These constraints may be social, or physical, or regulatory. They may make individuals more or less free, in some aggregate sense, than do property rules. Whether a commons in fact enhances freedom or harms it then, depends on how the commons is structured, and on how property rights in the resource would have been structured in the absence of a commons.

1.2 Describe historical and ongoing enclosure of the commons
  * To learn about the history of enclosure, it’s ongoing occurrence, and what enclosure even is, please read the following content.
1.1.2 Wikipedia History of Enclosure (CC-BY-SA)
  * Enclosure (sometimes inclosure) was the legal process in England during the 18th century of enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm.[1] Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. In England and Wales the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of arable farming in open fields. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (enclosed) and deeded or entitled to one or more owners.   * The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century.   * By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands.
  * Enclosure could be accomplished by buying the ground rights and all common rights to accomplish exclusive rights of use, which increased the value of the land. The other method was by passing laws causing or forcing enclosure, such as Parliamentary enclosure. The latter process of enclosure was sometimes accompanied by force, resistance, and bloodshed, and remains among the most controversial areas of agricultural and economic history in England. Marxist and neo-Marxist historians argue that rich landowners used their control of state processes to appropriate public land for their private benefit.
  * The process of enclosure created a landless working class that provided the labour required in the new industries developing in the north of England. For example: "In agriculture the years between 1760 and 1820 are the years of wholesale enclosure in which, in village after village, common rights are lost".[2] Thompson argues that "Enclosure (when all the sophistications are allowed for) was a plain enough case of class robbery."[3][4]
W. A. Armstrong, among others, argued that this is perhaps an oversimplification, that the better-off members of the European peasantry encouraged and participated actively in enclosure, seeking to end the perpetual poverty of subsistence farming. "We should be careful not to ascribe to [enclosure] developments that were the consequence of a much broader and more complex process of historical change."[5] "[T]he impact of eighteenth and nineteenth century enclosure has been grossly exaggerated ..."[6][7]
  * Enclosure is considered one of the causes of the British Agricultural Revolution. Enclosed land was under control of the farmer who was free to adopt better farming practices. There was widespread agreement in contemporary accounts that profit making opportunities were better with enclosed land.[8] Following enclosure, crop yields increased while at the same time labour productivity increased enough to create a surplus of labour. The increased labour supply is considered one of the causes of the Industrial Revolution.[9] Marx argued in Capital that enclosure played a constitutive role in the revolutionary transformation of feudalism into capitalism, both by transforming land from a means of subsistence into a means to realize profit on commodity markets (primarily wool in the English case), and by creating the conditions for the modern labour market by transforming small peasant proprietors and serfs into agricultural wage-labourers, whose opportunities to exit the market declined as the common lands were enclosed.[10]
1.2.2 Understanding enclosure as a concept, let’s take a look at the effects of enclosure upon the commons

1.3 Tragedy of the Commons
1.3.1 Sustainability of the Commons (CC BY)
  * Are Commons Sustainable? In the late 1960s Garrett Hardin coined an immensely effective trope, “the tragedy of the commons.” Originally aimed to explain why private incentives would lead to firms to pollute their environment even against their own long term interest, and thereby to justify pollution controls, the trope took on a life of its own. It came to stand for a proposition that all commons are tragic, and that property rights are a necessary precondition to efficient, or even sustainable, resource management. Over the past twenty years or so, we have seen the development of a literature that challenges this now-standard understanding of commons. Most crisply this effort has come to be crystallized in the work of Eleanor Ostrom. A recent review and bibliographic essay by Hess and Ostrom provides an excellent overview of this literature. The crux of most of this work is that there are certain circumstances under which common property regimes are sustainable, and quite possibly more efficient than individual property regimes. More generally, one can say that commons and property exist on a spectrum of institutional arrangements. Where along this spectrum a resource management system should be so as to be sustainable and efficient depends on technological characteristics of the resource and on patterns of its usage at any given historical moment. Carol Rose early identified that resources that have increasing returns to scale on the demand side, like network externalities, are particularly good candidates for commons. She used this insight to suggest why roads and canals, classic trade instrumentalities, tended to gravitate towards commons models even if they began as private property. Ellickson described a phenomenon in land, whereby the size of the group of owners – from one to many – is a function of the use of land and the likely failures that would have to be dealt with in its management. With regard to information, culture, and communications systems, I have explained how resources necessary for information production and communications systems can be managed as commons in ways that are sustainable and desirable. Information is a public good in the strict economic sense, and is also input into its own production process. Because of these unusual characteristics, few, if any, economists would argue against the proposition that a substantial commons in information goods is not only sustainable, but indeed is necessary for efficient and innovative information production systems. Beyond the public goods characteristics of information, the digitally networked environment is also pervaded by resources that, while not public goods in the strict economic sense, nonetheless function well on a commons model. They represent instances where sharing resources in a commons tends to reduce scarcity and perform better than property-based systems. I have written in detail about why wireless communications capacity has this characteristic and why human creativity in large scale, Internet-based collaborations like free software and other peer production enterprises similarly share this characteristic. The core point across these different domains of resources for information production and communication is that there is some aspect of a resource – like wireless communications capacity, human creativity, distributed processing capacity, distributed storage – that make its clearance through a market particularly clunky, expensive, and inefficient. In those cases, low cost communications and cheap processors that form an integral part of information production and exchange make the conditions ripe for sustainable large-scale collaborations and a sharing of resources based on commons, rather than property oriented, institutional arrangements. 

1.3.2 More on flaws in the tragedy of the commons
  * http://www.onthecommons.org/debunking-tragedy-commons (CC-BY-SA)
  * “The fallacies of the “tragedy of the commons” argument have been made many times since biologist Garrett Hardin made them in 1968. But given the persistence of the metaphor as a justification for privatization, it is always worth revisiting the issue. A recent critique of the “tragedy” myth, by Ian Angus, editor of Climate and Capitalism, appears in The Bullet, an e-bulletin of the Socialist Project, an organization based in Toronto.
  * Angus notes that Hardin offers no empirical evidence that herders actually overgraze their cattle on shared plots of land, let alone that this is the general rule for shared resources. He also notes that Hardin provides no evidence that private ownership necessarily manages a resource more responsibly; indeed, the “tragedy of the market” is a well-documented phenomenon. Angus also reviews briefly the political usefulness of the tragedy thesis, and its continued misuse in contemporary economics and policy.”
1.4 Culture as a Commons
1.4.1 Play the free culture game to apply your understanding of Free Culture 
  * http://www.molleindustria.org/en/freeculturegame/   


**Learning activities / assessments** are:
  * Identify a Commons you participate in and briefly describe the nature of the resources shared in that Commons, some of the people who participate in that Commons, and some of the community’s norms about how to create, manage, and sustain the resources in that Commons. How do you benefit from your participation in that Commons? What do you contribute to that Commons?
  * Identify a resource that you currently use and find a commons resource to replace that artifact with a commons resource
  * Select an artifact and evaluate its added contribution to the commons 
  * Identify a commons and release an artifact into the commons (can be as simple as a picture). Provide a link to this artifact along with a few sentences explaining its contribution to the commons.
