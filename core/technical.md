Creative Commons licenses and tools are native to the Internet. The Technical Implementation module helps you learn how to use Creative Commons technologies and integrate Creative Commons into other technologies.

The Technical Implementation module has eight units of learning:

1. Use Creative Commons License Chooser
2. Discovery and Upload of Creative Commons Licensed Content
3. Differentiate Legal Openness from Technical Openness 
4. Technical Integration
5. Implement Display of License Logos
6. Design Discovery Tools for Creative Commons Licensed Content
7. Implement Creative Commons Metadata Standards
8. Implement Automated Attribution

## Learning Experience

To help you learn Technical Implementation each unit of learning has:

1. A set of learning objectives

2. Open Educational Resources for you to use in fulfilling those objectives

3. Learning activities / assessments that ask you to apply the learning to your own context and generate evidence demonstrating you've accomplished the learning. 

Learning units have been sequenced to have a logical flow but you can take them in any order. Start with the one that interests you the most.
