# Creative Commons CORE

CORE defines the extensive range of knowledge and skills associated with becoming expert in all aspects of Creative Commons. The comprehensive breadth of CORE is depicted as a set of module topics and their associated learning units. Depth is defined by learning objectives within each unit. 

Creative Commons created CORE as foundational curricula from which specialized Creative Commons certificates can be built. The first phase of CC certificate development for librarians, educators and government involved identifying which CORE modules and learning units were relevant to people in those professions. A unique subset of CORE was identified as relevant for each. The corresponding CORE modules and learning units form the first part of learning for the librarian, educator, and government certificates.

Librarians, educators, and government each have their own unique Creative Commons use cases. On top of CORE a second part of the learning was designed to provide the additional specialized learning associated with how each profession uses Creative Commons. Each of the certificates combines parts of CORE with specialized learning associated with how CC is used in practice.

None of the certificates for librarians, educators, or government require participants to learn all of CORE. However, Creative Commons has authored CORE curricula as Open Educational Resources open and accessible to all. As a result, librarians, educators, and government staff interested in exploring CORE modules and learning units not required as part of their learning path are welcome to do so.

Institutions and organizations wanting to become authorized to deliver Creative Commons certificate training will be required to go through a train-the-trainer process involving all of CORE and the additional specialized learning associated with each of the librarian, educator, and government certificates. 

CORE modules are:
  * [Copyright ](copyright/index.md)
  * [The Commons](commons/index.md)
  * [Using Creative Commons Licenses](licenses.md)
  * [Sociocultural](social-cultural.md)
  * [Legal](legal.md)
  * [Technical](technical.md)

Global differences or considerations associated with each topic are included within each module.

The pale grey lines divide each module into units of learning. 

## Units of Learning

Units of learning across all CORE modules are:
