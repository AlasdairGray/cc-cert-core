# Creative Commons License Suite

![Six Units of Learning](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-cert-map/blob/master/img/cc-licenses-bricks.jpg "Creative Commons License Suite Units")

The Creative Commons copyright licenses offer flexible options still within copyright law's “all rights reserved” setting. "Our tools give everyone from individual creators to large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work."

All Creative Commons licenses helps creators retain their copyright while permitting others to copy, distribute, and make some uses of their work. Every Creative Commons license also ensures licensors get the credit for their work they deserve.  Creative Commons license works around the world and lasts as long as applicable copyright lasts.

1. How licenses work with respect to copyright
2. License differences
3. Examples of license uses
4. Differences between CC0 vs Public Domain Mark
5. Remixing different CC licensed works
6. Legal Precedence
