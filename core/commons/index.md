# The Commons

The commons has long played a historical role in making cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society. 

Creative Commons is part of that long tradition complementing the historical local and natural resource based commons with a contemporary global digital commons. Understanding the commons and how it works is essential to successfully using Creative Commons.

The Commons module has four units of learning that provide a grounding in the commons and Creative Commons role in stewarding and supporting it.


* [Unit #1: Significance of the Commons](significance.md) - What is the history of the idea of a Commons and how is it manifested in the world today?
* [Unit #2: Compare / Contrast Physical vs Digital Commons](physical-digital.md) - Explore the similarities and differences between physical and digital commons.
* [Unit #3: Understand Commons Opportunity](opportunity.md) - How can society benefit from a thriving commons?
* [Unit #4: Creative Commons](creative-commons.md) - Understand Creative Commons role in supporting and stewarding the digital commons.


On completion of these four units there is a mastery learning activity that combines learning across all four units into one final assignment for the whole module.
