## The Big Question

Imagine a world in which someone has invented a machine that can produce perfect copies of any food item. All you have to do is put in a single bowl of rice, or slice of pizza, or an apple, or a piece of cake, and the machine can make an infinite number of perfect copies for anyone who asks. And it can make those copies instantaneously. And for free. What would that world be like?


The internet is exactly this kind of machine. All you have to do is upload a bit of writing, or an image, or a video - anything that can be represented and stored as bits - and the machine can  make an infinite number of perfect copies for anyone who asks. And it can make those copies instantaneously. And for free. And send them anywhere around the world at the speed of light. What is our world currently like? What could it be like if we leveraged this technology to its potential?

## Learning Outcomes

* Provide examples of physical and digital commons
* Compare scarce (physical) vs. non-scarce (digital) resources
* Explain non-rivalrous goods
* Consider the Internet as a copying machine
* Evaluate marginal cost of $0
* Analyze copyright impact on resources


## Opening Questions

Why do we have the internet - perhaps the perfect machine for the free and open sharing of content - but not a copy machine for food? What are some of the differences between physical things like food and digital things like videos and web pages? How might these differences change the way we engage in Commons centered on digital resources?

## Your Quest: Taking on the Big Question

Digital technologies like the internet gives us incredible sharing capabilities never before imagined. With a physical newspaper, you have to wait for your spouse to finish reading one section before you can read it. However, if the same news is published online, you can both read it at the same time – in fact, millions of people can.


This conversion of content from a private good to a public good has far-reaching implications that are difficult to fully comprehend. It can be difficult to want to share a DVD (a private good), because while your friend is watching it you’re unable to. However, it’s easy to want to share YouTube videos, because a million people can watch them at the same time. (Imagine getting an error message that said, “Sorry. Someone else is currently watching this video. Please try again later.”) This shift in the very nature of sharing creates incredible opportunities for the Commons – especially where access to scarce physical resources has historically been a problem.


However.


Just because the internet makes it technologically possible for us to share and participate in a worldwide digital Commons doesn’t mean that we’re *allowed* to do so. Copyright law strictly regulates who is allowed to copy and share with whom. In other words, what the internet makes simple and free, copyright law make complicated and expense. Even more simply, *what the internet enables copyright regulates* - free and instantaneous sharing around the globe.
