## Why Needed?
Librarians have always been keepers and distributors of knowledge. In the 21st century their role is expanding in new ways. Library collections are increasingly digital. The copyright expertise librarians have is being complemented with open [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) based advances. 

Libraries are adding makerspaces, learning labs, 3D printing, and digital media studios to their traditional collections of books and periodicals. In this new, more digital environment, librarians have a critical role to play enhancing the media literacy of their patrons, from kids to scientists. 

The CC Librarian Certificate aims to ensure all librarians have the 21st century knowledge and skills they need to successfully perform Creative Commons related library functions and help patrons extend access to knowledge.

## Who is this for?

The Creative Commons Librarian Certificate is for librarians seeking to acquire Creative Commons knowledge and skills in support of increasing capacity and services for library functions associated with Open Access (OA), open data, Open Educational Resources (OER), open science, and the public domain.

## What you skills and knowledge will you gain?

On completion of the certificate librarians will be able to:

* explain the benefits of Creative Commons licenses
* raise awareness of knowledge sharing and distribution opportunities associated with openness
* support the curation and creation of open resources
* provide Creative Commons related training and support services
* help plan institutional systematic changes towards openness




CORE defines the range of knowledge and skills associated with being expert in all aspects of Creative Commons. 

CORE is for those who need deep and comprehensive knowledge of Creative Commons including individuals and organizations wanting to become authorized to deliver Creative Commons certificate training. 

CORE is comprised of modules and learning units.

## Modules

## Units of learning

In addition to being its own standalone certificate, CORE is foundational curricula from which specialized Creative Commons certificates are built. Creative Commons certificates for librarians, educators, and government start with a subset of CORE as foundation, on top of which specialized learning is added specific to how each profession uses Creative Commons. Getting a Creative Commons librarian, educator, or government certificate involves completing both the CORE and specialized learning parts.

While only a subset of CORE is used for each specialized certificate, all of CORE is open and accessible. Librarians, educators, and government staff wanting to pursue deeper knowledge can access and learn from all of CORE even parts not on their learning path.
